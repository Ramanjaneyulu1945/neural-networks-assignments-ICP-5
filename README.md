Explanation for code 1
We need to import some libraries like pandas for handling data, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and metrices for evaluating our model.
we already have a dataset so we will load it into the program. 
we split the data for training and testing.
once the model is trained we can use to predict types of glass in our test data.

Explanation for code 2
we need to import libraries like pandas for data handling and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
By using the pandas we load the dataset into the program.
And then the data is seperated into two parts one is training the 
SVM model and anothe one is for testing the model's performance.
